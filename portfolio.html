					<p class="project-description"><strong>Description:</strong> 
						I conducted my thesis in collaboration with the <a href="https://perivallon-he.eu/">PERIVALLON</a> project, 
						co-funded by the European Union. My research focused on detecting illegal waste disposal through satellite image analysis, 
						specifically using supervised classification and weakly supervised segmentation with the 
						<a href="https://zenodo.org/records/7034382">AerialWaste dataset</a> from Lombardy, provided by ARPA. The project’s goal was to develop deep learning models to identify 
						illegal landfills across Europe using satellite imagery.</br>
						During the project, I faced several technical challenges:</br>
						- Scarcity of Annotated Data: I used data augmentation techniques like flipping and noise addition to expand the dataset and enhance model performance.</br>
						- Class Imbalance: I addressed this by employing class weights and oversampling to improve landfill detection.</br>
						- Varying Image Sizes: To standardize images from different satellites, I created a preprocessing pipeline using bilinear interpolation and zero padding.</br>
						- Lack of Localization Annotations: I adopted weakly supervised learning through Hierarchical Heatmap Generation and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to localize areas of interest and assign pixel-level probability.</br>
						These approaches boosted classification accuracy from 80% to about 90%. Despite limited hardware resources, I developed effective models 
						to handle the extensive data involved.

					<p class="project-description"><strong>Description:</strong> 
						I explored the efficacy of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) models using different text and image encoders. 
						My investigation focused on the COCO dataset, revealing that CLIP performance is significantly influenced by the complexity

						especially those with smaller patch sizes, yield better results. Moreover, on the COCO dataset, I utilized the embeddings 
						generated by CLIP encoders to train a decoder, enabling me to perform image captioning tasks with significant results. I leveraged 
						CLIP models with ViT16 and BERT to conduct image retrieval, zero-shot classification, and clustering tasks on the COCO dataset. 
						Subsequently, I extended my study to medical data from the Roco dataset and fashion data from the FashionProduct dataset.

					<p class="project-description"><strong>Description:</strong> 
						I engaged in an exciting Natural Language Processing project that centered around the Question Answering task, 
						utilizing the renowned SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset). This project presented a unique opportunity
						to explore various aspects of question answering. One of the key tasks was to determine whether a given answer 
						could be found in the text in response to a specific question. This involved analyzing the relationship between the 
						question and the provided text to assess the presence of the answer. Additionally, I focused on extracting the answer 
						directly from the text using the BERT model, which is well-suited for this type of task due to its ability to 
						understand context and semantics. Another important aspect of the project involved generating responses, which 
						could either be contextually informed by the text or independent of it, by utilizing generative models. To achieve 
						these objectives, I employed several state-of-the-art NLP models, including BERT, T5, and GPT-2. Rather than implementing 
						these models from scratch, I fine-tuned them on the SQuAD dataset using the Hugging Face library, which allowed me to 
						leverage pre-trained architectures and adapt them effectively for the specific requirements of the project.
